 
You are given an array of N integers.

However, you seemed to have found a better way of representing the array.

According to you the array can be better represented if the prime numbers from the given array are placed at prime indices and composite numbers at composite indices.

But with this representation, there arises the uncertainty of numbers that are neither prime nor composite. Hence, place '0' at such indices.

The spaces of ambiguity are then filled with zeroes. (The void spaces are filled with '0')

Output the array with better representation. (according to you)

(The Sequence of the prime and composite number must be maintained independently)

Input format

The first line contains a single integer t the number of test-cases.
The second line contains a single integer n the number of elements in the array.
The third and the last line contains the array elements A0, A1, A2, ... , An


Output format

For each case, display the elements of the modified array.


Constraints
1 <= t <= 10^5
1 <= n <= 10^5
2 <= Ai <= 10^5

Sample

2
4
3 11 2 6
6
6 7 3 4 5 9

Output

0 0 3 11 6 2
0 0 7 3 6 5 4 0 9


Explaination

Case 1 : The prime numbers are -> 3 11 2
The composite numbers are -> 6
Hence the numbers are placed at their corresponding indices.

Case 2 : The prime numbers are -> 7 3 5
The composite number ->6 4 9
Hence, the number are place at their corresponding indices.
